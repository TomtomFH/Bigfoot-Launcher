I made a custom launcher that starts instead of the game.
The bug of not being able to join servers drove me crazy, so I added the option to remove the startup animation and included a restart command to quickly close and reopen the game.
To install it, simply download both files and run the installer. Make sure both files are in the same folder!
After the installer finishes, you can simply open Bigfoot through Steam, and it will start the launcher.
